## üîí Production (Prod) Environment ‚Äì Service Accounts & IAM Roles

> **Project Purpose**: Hosts mission-critical GenAI apps and APIs. Must follow best practices for least-privilege IAM, logging, and deployment security.

### üë• Service Accounts

| **Service Account ** | **Display Name**                     | **Assigned Roles**                                                                                                                                                 | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `****-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` | Default Compute SA                  | `Editor`                                                                                                                                                           | Automatically created by GCP for Compute Engine VMs. Grants broad permissions; if not used, remove or restrict. Left as-is unless VM-based infra is used.               |
| `cicd-runner@***.iam.gserviceaccount.com`    | CI/CD Runner SA                     | `Cloud Run Developer`, `Service Account User`                                                                                                                      | Deploys Cloud Run services as part of Terraform or Cloud Build pipelines. Only needs roles to deploy and impersonate execution SAs, ensuring separation of concerns.    |
| `genai-app-sample-cr-sa@***.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Cloud Run GenAI App SA               | `Cloud Trace Agent`, `Discovery Engine Editor`, `Logs Writer`, `Storage Admin`, `Vertex AI User`                                                                  | Runtime identity for the GenAI application. Accesses Vertex AI, reads logs, writes metrics, and interacts with Discovery Engine. Strictly limited to what the app needs. |
| `local-vscode-gcp-auth@***.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Local VSCode Auth SA                | `Cloud Build Editor`, `Cloud Trace Agent`, `Logs Writer`, `Owner`, `Vertex AI Administrator`, `Vertex AI User`, `Viewer`                                          | Used by developers to connect VSCode to GCP locally. High privileges to support manual setup and debugging, but **should not be used in CI/CD or runtime workloads.**    |
| `account-email@example.com`                | Human Admin Account (You)           | `Owner`                                                                                                                                                            | The primary admin account. Use with MFA enabled. Reserved for emergency access, billing, and resource provisioning. Use with caution and audit regularly.                |

### üîê Security & IAM Best Practices ‚Äì Production

| **Area**                 | **Recommendation**                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Workload SAs**         | Assign only roles necessary for runtime, such as `Vertex AI User`, `Logs Writer`, `Storage Admin`. Avoid elevated roles like `Editor` or `Owner`.          |
| **CI/CD Service Account**| Limit to `Cloud Run Developer` and `Service Account User`. It should **never** deploy as itself but only act on behalf of narrowly scoped workload SAs.    |
| **Human Accounts**       | Enforce MFA and limit `Owner` to as few accounts as possible. Use IAM conditions, org policy, and SCC to detect excessive privileges.                       |
| **Audit & Logging**      | Ensure `Cloud Trace`, `Cloud Logging`, and `Cloud Monitoring` are enabled. Set up log sinks to store long-term audit logs securely.                        |
| **Secrets Management**   | Never store secrets in code. Use **Secret Manager**, and consider **Workload Identity Federation** to avoid using long-lived service account keys.         |
| **Network Security**     | Restrict access with **Firewall Rules**, **VPC Service Controls**, and **Private Service Connect**. Ensure Cloud Run is not set to "Allow unauthenticated".|

### üÜö Prod vs Staging Differences

| **Category**            | **Staging**                                                                                         | **Production**                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Policy**     | More permissive; may allow `Owner` or `Editor` roles for quicker iteration.                         | Enforces strict separation of duties; workload SAs must follow least-privilege. Avoid using `Owner` in automation.      |
| **SA Role Scope**       | May include elevated permissions temporarily.                                                       | Roles are narrowly scoped per function (CI/CD, workload, bootstrap).                                                    |
| **Service Account Usage**| Fewer restrictions on service accounts.                                                            | SAs must be scoped only to their job; identity separation between build, deploy, and runtime.                           |
| **Deployment Workflow** | Allows experimentation with in-place updates, less restriction on CI/CD.                            | Enforces approval workflows, tagged releases, artifact promotion, and rollback paths.                                   |
| **Log & Monitoring**    | Logging is used, but may not be strictly audited.                                                   | Logging and metrics must be complete, auditable, and persisted (e.g., via Log Sinks to BigQuery or GCS).                |
| **Naming Convention**   | Prefixes like `stagng-`, used for visibility.                                                       | Uses `prod-` or no prefix. Clear naming is enforced to distinguish between runtime and deployment identities.           |
