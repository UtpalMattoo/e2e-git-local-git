### üîç Explanations and Purpose

#### **Default Compute Service Account**
- **What it is**: Automatically created when Compute Engine is first enabled.
- **ID format**: `<project-number>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Role assigned**: `Editor` by default (‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for production workloads).
- **Recommendation**: Use **custom service accounts** for workloads and restrict this account's access.

#### **CI/CD Runner Service Account**
- **What it is**: Created by Terraform.
- **Purpose**: Executes Cloud Run deployments and interacts with other GCP services during CI/CD pipelines.
- **Roles**: `Cloud Run Developer`, `Service Account User`.

#### **GenAI App Runtime Service Account**
- **What it is**: Bound to the Cloud Run application in the staging environment.
- **Purpose**: Grants the app secure, least-privilege access to GCP services it needs to function.
- **Roles**: Access to Vertex AI, Discovery Engine, and Storage ‚Äî matching expected behavior for GenAI-based applications.

#### **Bootstrap Auth SA**
- **What it is**: A manually created service account used to authenticate local development tools like **VS Code** to GCP before Terraform applies infrastructure.
- **Purpose**: Enables Terraform execution, bootstrap configuration, and admin-level interaction with GCP from local dev environments.
- **Roles**: Broad privileges (`Owner`, `Vertex AI Admin`, `Logs Writer`, etc.)‚Äî**should not be used in production workloads**.

#### **Admin Account**
- **What it is**: A personal/admin Google account (e.g., `account_email@gmail.com`) with full Owner access.
- **Best Practice**: Use this account only for emergency escalations or manual project setup tasks.

### ‚úÖ Staging vs Dev Differences

| Area                  | Dev                                               |                 Staging                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **App Runtime SA**    | Not present or minimally scoped                   | Fully defined and bound to GenAI Cloud Run app       |
| **CI/CD Runner SA**   | Has broader permissions (Artifact Registry, etc.) | Scoped only to Cloud Run and SA usage                |
| **Roles**             | Dev is more permissive for testing/debugging      | Staging applies **least-privilege** for CI/CD flows  |
| **Usage Context**     | Local development and early bootstrapping         | Mid-tier environment for pre-prod testing            |

### ‚úÖ Prod vs Staging Differences

| Area                  | Staging                                          | Prod                                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **App Runtime SA**    | `stagng-project-id` domain                       | `prod-project-id` domain, identical roles                              |
| **CI/CD Runner SA**   | Narrower scope                                   | Similar narrow scope                                                   |
| **Compute SA**        | Different account ID, same default account type  | Same default pattern with project-specific ID                          |
| **Bootstrap Auth SA** | Present                                          | Present, same roles                                                    |
| **Security Policy**   | Slightly more flexible for experimentation       | Must follow stricter controls, should avoid Owner role on workload SAs |
